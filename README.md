##Synopsis
####An All Is Well user is either a client or a therapist. User signup allows for a client to enter their basic information, in addition to specifying who their therapist is. Once a client is logged in, they may write journal entries, complete a mood survey, read their therapist's shared notes, or post a significant emotional event for the therapist's viewing. A therapist can view all of their patient's activity on their homepage and submit notes for the patient to read. A therapist can also view their clients' logged emotional events in a calendar view to better establish timelines and behavioral patterns.
